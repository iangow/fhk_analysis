## Introduction

This document reproduces the results found in Table 15 and 16 of *Reply to "The Reg SHO Reanalysis Project: Reconsidering Fang, Huang and Karpoff (2016) on Reg SHO and Earnings Management" by Black et al. (2019)* (available on SSRN [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3507033)).
The tables provide results for regressions of performance-matched discretionary accruals on a treatment indicator, *PILOT*, two post-treatment indicators, *DURING* and *POST*, and interactions, *PILOT $\times$ DURING* ($\mathit{pilot\_during}$) and *PILOT $\times$ POST* ($\mathit{pilot\_post}$).
The coefficient of primary interest is that on *PILOT $\times$ DURING*.

To run this code, you will need:

1. An internet connection. 
(We get data from WRDS and a website.)
2. A WRDS ID. 
Before running the code, tell R your WRDS ID and password by running the following line in the R console before attempting to compile this code:^[Don't edit the line below in the source file, as (i) passwords don't belong in source code and (ii) this line is not run in compiling this file due to the `eval=FALSE` flag embedded in the code.]

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
Sys.setenv(PGUSER="your_WRDS_ID", PGPASSWORD="your_password")
```
3. To install the libraries used in the following chunk of code. 
For example, `install.packages("haven")`.
4. **Optional** To have LaTeX software installed (if you want to compile as a PDF). 
Compiling the document as HTML should not require LaTeX.
           
```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(haven)
library(lfe)
library(stargazer)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(broom)
library(DBI)
library(ggplot2)

Sys.setenv(PGHOST="wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu", PGDATABASE="wrds", PGPORT=9737)
```

## Getting the data

FHK use three data sources:

1. SHO data, which combines data from the SEC with analysis by the authors
2. Compustat
3. Fama-French industry data

### SHO data

We can gain insight into the construction of the SHO indicator by using two SAS data files that embed the data used by FHK.
The following code reproduces the analysis by FHK.
There are effectively two elements: `pilot` provides the `PILOT` indicator and `pmda` identifies the firm-years (`gvkey`-`fyear` values) to be considered.
The file `pilot.sas7bdat` includes variables such as `lpermno` and `linkdt`, suggesting that the WRDS table `crsp.stocknames` was used in its construction.

```{r sho_data, cache=TRUE}
pilot <- read_sas("data/pilot.sas7bdat")
pmda <- read_sas("data/pmda.sas7bdat")

sho_data <-
    pilot %>%
    select(gvkey1, SHO) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    group_by(gvkey1) %>%
    filter(n() == 1) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    inner_join(pilot, by = c("gvkey1", "SHO")) %>%
    rename(sho = SHO) %>%
    mutate(gvkey = str_pad(gvkey1, width = 6, side = "left", pad = "0")) %>%
    select(gvkey, sho) 
  
sho_firm_years <-
    pmda %>%
    mutate(gvkey = str_pad(gvkey1, width = 6, side = "left", pad = "0")) %>%
    select(-gvkey1) %>%
    filter(fyear >= 2000) %>%
    inner_join(sho_data, by = "gvkey") %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, datadate, sho)
```

In constructing the `PILOT` indicator, FHK omit cases (`gvkey1` values) where there is more than one distinct value for the indicator.
A question is: Who are these firms? Why is there more than one value for `PILOT` for these firms? And does omission of these make sense?

```{r dependson="sho_data"}
sho_dupes <-
    pilot %>%
    select(gvkey1, SHO) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    group_by(gvkey1) %>%
    filter(n() > 1) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    inner_join(pilot, by = c("gvkey1", "SHO")) %>%
    rename(sho = SHO) %>%
    mutate(gvkey = str_pad(gvkey1, width = 6, side = "left", pad = "0")) %>%
    select(gvkey, lpermno, rsticker, sho) %>%
    arrange(gvkey)

sho_dupes
```

From the analysis above, we see that tickers `X`, `ITG`, and `MEE` have zero for `sho`, but are associated with `gvkey` (and `permno`) values where `sho` is one for a different ticker.
The ticker (`rsticker`) values in `sho.sas7bdat` seem to match those available on the SEC's [website]( https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/34-50104.htm).

```{r stocknames, include=FALSE}
pg <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

stocknames <- tbl(pg, sql("SELECT * FROM crsp.stocknames"))
ccmxpf_linktable <- tbl(pg, sql("SELECT * FROM crsp.ccmxpf_linktable"))
```

Using the tables `crsp.stocknames` and `crsp.ccmxpf_linktable`, my conclusion is that the GVKEY matches for the tickers `JEF`, `FLR`, and `MRO` are simply wrong.
Based on my analysis, these are the correct GVKEY matches and all three cases should be included with `sho` equal to one.

| Ticker | GVKEY |
|--------|-------|
| JEF    | 006239|
| FLR    | 004818|
| MRO    | 010970|

- Picking one of these tickers, how can you match that ticker to the GVKEY value I have provided? Do you agree with my approach?

Tony's comments: I agree with your approach. From the SEC's [website]( https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/34-50104.htm), we can clearly see that tickers `JEF`(JEFFERIES GROUP INC) , `FLR`(FLUOR CORP) , and `MRO`(MARATHON OIL CORP) are all in the Pilot list. As gvkey is a permanent unique firm identifier, and a firm is either in or not in the list, two `PILOT` values for a gvkey must be a bad match. In addition, omission of these due to a matching failure does not make sense. The following code can be used to get the right gvkeys(but I am having this different: did I miss something?):

```{r stocknames, include=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

sho_dupes_correctgvkey <-
    pilot %>%
    filter(SHO==1) %>%  
    inner_join(sho_dupes, by = "rsticker") %>%
    select(rsticker, RSNAME) %>%
    rename(ticker = rsticker) %>%
    inner_join(stocknames, by = "ticker",`copy` = TRUE) %>%
    filter (year(namedt) <= 2004 & 2004 <= year(nameenddt)) %>%
    rename(lpermno = permno) %>%
    inner_join(ccmxpf_linktable, by = "lpermno",`copy` = TRUE) %>%
    filter (year(linkdt) <= 2004) %>%
    filter ((year(linkenddt) >= 2004) | is.na(linkenddt)) %>%
    select(ticker, gvkey)

sho_dupes_correctgvkey
```
Fixing the issue with mismatched GVKEYs (and issues related to which firms should be used as controls) is complicated, so we won't attempt that here.

But another issue is implicit in the code below:

```{r dependson="sho_data"}
sho_data %>% 
  count(gvkey) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

- What is the issue implied in the above? 
How would you fix this issue?
- Does fixing this issue affect the results in any way?
Why or why not?

Tony's comments: the issue is that 32 gvkeys appear in the SHO dataset for two times. It could be fixed by using `distinct()` function to remove the duplicates in the `sho_data`. Fixing this issue may not affect the results in any way because they are just duplicates.

```{r dependson="sho_data"}
sho_data %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  count(gvkey) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

### Fama-French data

I grab this data set directly from Ken French's website.

```{r ff_data, cache=TRUE}
get_ff_ind <- function(num = 48) {
    t <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip") 
    
    url <- paste0("https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/Siccodes", num, ".zip")
    
    download.file(url, t)
    
    ff_data <- 
        readr::read_fwf(unzip(t), 
                 col_positions = readr::fwf_widths(c(3, 7, NA),
                                            c("ff_ind", "ff_ind_short_desc", "sic_range")),
                col_types = "icc") %>%
        mutate(ff_ind_desc = if_else(!is.na(ff_ind_short_desc), sic_range, NA_character_)) %>%
        tidyr::fill(ff_ind, ff_ind_short_desc, ff_ind_desc) %>%
        filter(grepl("^[0-9]", sic_range)) %>%
        tidyr::extract(sic_range, 
                into = c("sic_min", "sic_max", "sic_desc"),
                regex = "^([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)(.*)$",
                convert = TRUE) %>%
        mutate(sic_desc = trimws(sic_desc)) %>%
        mutate(ff_ind_category = paste0("ff_", num)) %>%
        select(ff_ind_category, everything())
    
    ff_data
}

# Get Fama-French 48-industry data
ff_data <-
    get_ff_ind(48) %>%
    rowwise() %>% 
    mutate(sich = list(seq(from = sic_min, to = sic_max))) %>% 
    unnest(sich) %>% 
    rename(ff48 = ff_ind) %>%
    select(ff48, sich)
```
- Set `num <- 48` and work through the body of the `get_ff_ind` function line by line?
Do you understand what the code is doing?
- What are these lines doing? 
```{r eval=FALSE}
    mutate(sich = list(seq(from = sic_min, to = sic_max))) %>% 
        unnest(sich) %>% 
```

Tony's comments: the `get_ff_ind` function is easy to follow. The function directly downloads Fama French industry classification tables and transforms them into ready-to-merge rectangular tables.
These lines generate the sequence from sic_min to sic_max, and combine all the objects in the sequence (each represents an SICH belonging to the corresponding ff48) into a list, for each row in the ff_data(48) table.

### Compustat data

We can get the data we need from the WRDS PostgreSQL database.

```{r pg_data, cache=TRUE}
pg <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

comp.funda <- tbl(pg, sql("SELECT * FROM comp.funda"))

compustat_annual <-
    comp.funda %>%
    filter(indfmt == 'INDL', datafmt == 'STD', popsrc == 'D', consol == 'C',
           between(fyear, 1999, 2012)) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, datadate, fyr, sich, dltt, dlc, seq, oibdp,
			ib, ibc, oancf, xidoc, at, ppegt, sale, rect, ceq, csho, prcc_f) %>%
    mutate(fyear = as.integer(fyear)) %>%
    collect()
```

```{r controls, dependson="pg_data", cache=TRUE}
controls_a <- 	
    compustat_annual %>%
    filter(!between(sich, 6000, 6999) | !between(sich, 4900, 4949)) %>%
    group_by(gvkey) %>%
    arrange(fyear) %>%
    mutate(lag_fyear = lag(fyear),
           mtob = if_else(lag(ceq) != 0, 
                          lag(csho) * lag(prcc_f)/lag(ceq), NA_real_),
           leverage = if_else(dltt + dlc + seq != 0, 
                              (dltt + dlc) / (dltt + dlc + seq) * 100, NA_real_),
           roa = if_else(lag(at) > 0, oibdp/lag(at), NA_real_)) %>%
    filter(fyear == lag(fyear) + 1) %>%
    select(gvkey, datadate, fyear, at, mtob, leverage, roa)

controls_b <-
    controls_a %>%
    group_by(gvkey) %>%
    arrange(fyear) %>%
    fill(at, mtob, leverage, roa) %>%
    ungroup()

controls_fyear <-
    controls_b %>%
    group_by(fyear) %>%
    summarize_at(vars(at, mtob, leverage, roa), ~ mean(., na.rm=TRUE))

df_controls <-
  controls_b %>%
  inner_join(controls_fyear, by = "fyear", suffix=c("", "_avg")) %>%
  mutate(at = coalesce(at, at_avg),
         mtob = coalesce(mtob, mtob_avg),
         leverage = coalesce(leverage, leverage_avg),
         roa = coalesce(roa, roa_avg)) %>%
  select(gvkey, fyear, at, mtob, leverage, roa)
```

- Why is `filter(fyear == lag(fyear) + 1)` required?
- What are the authors doing in the creation of `controls_b`? (Hint: The key "verb" is `fill`.) 
Does this seem appropriate?
- What are the authors doing in the creation of `df_controls` from `controls_fyear`?
Does this seem appropriate?
- How would you change the code to skip the two steps above? 
Does doing so make a difference?

Tony's comments:
- `filter(fyear == lag(fyear) + 1)` is required to make sure the lagged values are actually from the previous fyear, instead of two or more years before.
- With the creation of `controls_b`, the authors are populating missing values with the most recent available values (no matter how stale they are). I am not quite sure this is appropriate. There is a trade-off between sample size and data accuracy in this case.
- With the creation of `df_controls` from `controls_fyear`, the authors are populating missing values with yearly average of non-misssing values. I am not sure this is appropriate. Similar to the previous treatment.
- I would change the code to skip the two steps above as follows. Doing so will not make a significant difference. Doing the treatment as the authors did only increase the controls sample size to 99,473 from 84,685, at the cost of adding measurement errors.

```{r controls, dependson="pg_data", cache=TRUE}

                          lag(csho) * lag(prcc_f)/lag(ceq), NA_real_),
           leverage = if_else(dltt + dlc + seq != 0, 
                              (dltt + dlc) / (dltt + dlc + seq) * 100, NA_real_),
           roa = if_else(lag(at) > 0, oibdp/lag(at), NA_real_)) %>%
    filter(fyear == lag(fyear) + 1) %>%
    select(gvkey, datadate, fyear, at, mtob, leverage, roa) %>%

    left_join(df_da8, by=c("gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
    arrange(gvkey, fyear) 
```

- Why does the code look different for the odd-numbered datasets (e.g., `df_da1`)
and the even-numbered datasets (e.g., `df_da2`).
- Does the argument for using `salerect_c_at * b_sale_c_at` make sense to you?

Tony's comments: 
- The codes look different for the odd-numbered datasets and the even-numbered datasets because they calculate DAs differently. The odd-numbered datasets first estimate a modified Jones model with intercept term. Then they used the model to get the fitted normal accruals. Then the da is calculated as the difference between the total accruals and the fitted normal accruals. In contrast, the even-numbered datasets estimate a modified Jones model without the intercept term, and da is calculated as the residue.

- Does the argument for using `salerect_c_at * b_sale_c_at` make sense to you?
Although it claims to have followed Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney (1995), I am not very sure whether its argument that credit sales might also
provide a potential opportunity for accounting distortion makes sense to me, because it is meant to calculate fitted normal accruals. In addition, it is a bit weird to use the coefficient and a different underlying variable to calculate fitted normal accruals.

### Performance-matching code

```{r pmdas, dependson=c("est_das", "pg_data"), cache=TRUE}
perf <-
    merged %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, ff48) %>% 
    inner_join(
        compustat_annual %>% 
            mutate(fyear = fyear + 1), by = c("gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
    mutate(ib_at = if_else(at > 0, ib/at, NA_real_)) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, ff48, ib_at) 
     
perf_match <-
    perf %>%
    inner_join(perf, by = c("fyear", "ff48"),
               suffix = c("", "_other")) %>%
    filter(gvkey != gvkey_other) %>%
    mutate(perf_diff = abs(ib_at - ib_at_other)) %>%
    group_by(gvkey, fyear) %>%
    filter(perf_diff == min(perf_diff)) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, ff48, gvkey_other)
 
perf_matched_accruals <-
    merged %>%
    rename(gvkey_other = gvkey) %>%
    select(gvkey_other, fyear, matches("^da"))

pm_disc_accruals <-
    merged %>%
    inner_join(perf_match, by = c("ff48", "gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
    inner_join(perf_matched_accruals, by = c("fyear", "gvkey_other"),
               suffix = c("", "_other")) %>%
    mutate(da1_adj = da1 - da1_other,
           da2_adj = da2 - da2_other,
           da3_adj = da3 - da3_other,
           da4_adj = da4 - da4_other,
           da_lr1_adj = da_lr1 - da_lr1_other,
           da_lr2_adj = da_lr2 - da_lr2_other,
           da_lr3_adj = da_lr3 - da_lr3_other,
           da_lr4_adj = da_lr4 - da_lr4_other) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, matches("_adj"))
```

- What does the line `mutate(fyear = fyear + 1)` effectively do? 
Would it be possible to create `perf` using an alternative approach? (Hint: Use `lag`?)
Does this give the same result?
- Does the code above ensure that a performance-matched control firm is used as a control just once?
If so, which aspect of the code ensures this is true? 
If not, how might you ensure this? (Just describe the approach in general; no need to do this.)

Tony's comments:
- The line `mutate(fyear = fyear + 1)` add one to the fyear for `compustat_annual` so that the inner_join will actually match `perf` with `compustat_annual` for the previous fyear to get the lagged ib_at.

An alternative approach is to use lag, which will give the same result.

```{r pmdas, dependson=c("est_das", "pg_data"), cache=TRUE}
perf_alt <-
    compustat_annual %>%
    group_by(gvkey) %>%
    arrange(fyear) %>%
    mutate(lag_fyear = lag(fyear),
           ib_at = if_else(lag(at) > 0, lag(ib)/lag(at), NA_real_)) %>%
    filter(fyear == lag(fyear) + 1) %>%
    inner_join(merged, by = c("gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, ff48, ib_at)
```

-The code above does not ensure that a performance-matched control firm is used as a control just once. 
```{r pmdas, dependson=c("est_das", "pg_data"), cache=TRUE}
perf_match %>%
    group_by(fyear) %>%

## Data preparation

### Merge data sets

```{r merge_controls, dependson=c("pmdas", "controls", "sho_data"), cache=TRUE}
pm_disc_accruals_sorted <-
    pm_disc_accruals %>%
    group_by(gvkey, fyear) %>%
    filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
    ungroup() 

sho_accruals_prewin <-
  sho_firm_years %>%
  left_join(df_controls, 
            by = c("gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
  left_join(pm_disc_accruals_sorted, 
            by = c("gvkey", "fyear"))
```

### Winsorize the data

```{r winsorize, dependson="merge_controls", cache=TRUE}
winsorize <- function(x, prob = 0.01, p_low = prob, p_high = 1-prob) {
    cuts <- quantile(x, probs = c(p_low, p_high), 
                     type = 2, na.rm = TRUE)
    x[x < cuts[1]] <- cuts[1]
    x[x > cuts[2]] <- cuts[2]
    x
}

win_vars <- c("at", "mtob", "leverage", "roa", "da1_adj", "da2_adj", 
                 "da3_adj", "da4_adj", "da_lr1_adj", "da_lr2_adj", 
                 "da_lr3_adj", "da_lr4_adj")

sho_accruals <-
    sho_accruals_prewin %>%
    group_by(fyear) %>%
    mutate_at(all_of(win_vars), winsorize, prob=0.01) %>%
    ungroup()
```

- In an online appendix BDLYY say "FHK winsorize covariates for their covariate balance table at 1/99%. We inferred that they also winsorized accruals at this level. Whether they winsorize across sample years or within each year, they do not specify."
The code above winsorized within each year.
How would you modify the code to winsorize "across sample years? Does it make a difference?
- How would you modify the code to winsorize at the 2%/98% level? Does this make a difference?
- How would you modify the code to not winsorize at all? Does this make a difference?

Tony's comments:
- To winsorize "across sample years", the code should be modified as the following (need: install.packages("arsenal") before running the code). This makes a difference.

```{r winsorize, dependson="merge_controls", cache=TRUE}
sho_accruals_alt <-
    sho_accruals_prewin %>%
    mutate_at(all_of(win_vars), winsorize, prob=0.01) %>%
    ungroup()

library(arsenal)
comparedf(sho_accruals, sho_accruals_alt)
```
- To winsorize at the 2%/98% level, the code should be modified as the following. This makes a difference.
```{r winsorize, dependson="merge_controls", cache=TRUE}
sho_accruals_alt <-
    sho_accruals_prewin %>%
    group_by(fyear) %>%
    mutate_at(all_of(win_vars), winsorize, prob=0.02) %>%
    ungroup()

comparedf(sho_accruals, sho_accruals_alt)
```
- We don't need code to not winsorize at all. But if do want to use the function, we can do as the following as well. And winsorization does make a difference.
```{r winsorize, dependson="merge_controls", cache=TRUE}
comparedf(sho_accruals_prewin, sho_accruals_alt)

sho_accruals_alt <-
    sho_accruals_prewin %>%
    group_by(fyear) %>%
    mutate_at(all_of(win_vars), winsorize, prob=0) %>%
    ungroup()
comparedf(sho_accruals_prewin, sho_accruals_alt)
comparedf(sho_accruals, sho_accruals_alt)
```

```{r pm_das, dependson="winsorize", cache=TRUE}
reg_data <-
    sho_accruals %>%
    mutate(leverage = leverage/100,
           year = year(datadate),
           during = year %in% c(2005, 2006, 2007),
           post = year %in% c(2008, 2009, 2010),
           log_at = log(at),
           pilot = sho,
           pilot_during = pilot * during,
           pilot_post = pilot * post) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, log_at, leverage, mtob, roa,
           da1_adj, da2_adj, da3_adj, da4_adj, 
           da_lr1_adj, da_lr2_adj, da_lr3_adj, da_lr4_adj,
           year, during, post, pilot, pilot_during, pilot_post)
```

- Some of the studies discussed by BDLYY exclude 2004 data from the sample.
How would you modify the above code to do this here?
- Would excluding 2004 here make a significant difference?

Tony's comments:
- To exclude 2004 data from the sample, the code could be modified as the following. This makes a difference (At least, the sample size will be different)

```{r pm_das, dependson="winsorize", cache=TRUE}
reg_data_alt <-
    sho_accruals %>%
    mutate(leverage = leverage/100,
           year = year(datadate),
           during = year %in% c(2005, 2006, 2007),
           post = year %in% c(2008, 2009, 2010),
           log_at = log(at),
           pilot = sho,
           pilot_during = pilot * during,
           pilot_post = pilot * post) %>%
    select(gvkey, fyear, log_at, leverage, mtob, roa,
           da1_adj, da2_adj, da3_adj, da4_adj, 
           da_lr1_adj, da_lr2_adj, da_lr3_adj, da_lr4_adj,
           year, during, post, pilot, pilot_during, pilot_post) %>%
  filter(year!=2004)

comparedf(reg_data, reg_data_alt)
```
## Regression analysis

```{r reg_functions, cache=FALSE}
lhs <- c("da1_adj", "da2_adj", "da3_adj", "da4_adj",
         "da_lr1_adj", "da_lr2_adj", "da_lr3_adj", "da_lr4_adj")
controls <- c("log_at", "mtob", "roa", "leverage")

reg_year_fe <- function(y, firm_fe = FALSE, cl_2 = TRUE) {
    model <- paste0(y, " ~ pilot_during + pilot_post + pilot + ",
                      paste(controls, collapse = " + "),
                      if_else(firm_fe, "| gvkey + year ", "| year "),
                    "| 0 ",
                    if_else(!cl_2, "| gvkey ", "| year + gvkey"))
    fm <- felm(as.formula(model), data = reg_data)
    fm
}
```

- Code in the previous subsection creates variables `pilot_during` and `pilot_post`. 
Is it necessary to do so to estimate the regressions here? 
If not how would you modify the string `" ~ pilot_during + pilot_post + pilot + ",` 
in the code above to not use these variables? 

Tony's comments:
Probably not necessary. To not use these variables, run the following code:

```{r reg_functions, cache=FALSE}
lhs <- c("da1_adj", "da2_adj", "da3_adj", "da4_adj",
         "da_lr1_adj", "da_lr2_adj", "da_lr3_adj", "da_lr4_adj")
controls <- c("log_at", "mtob", "roa", "leverage")

reg_year_fe <- function(y, firm_fe = FALSE, cl_2 = TRUE) {
    model <- paste0(y, " ~ pilot + ",
                      paste(controls, collapse = " + "),
                      if_else(firm_fe, "| gvkey + year ", "| year "),
                    "| 0 ",
                    if_else(!cl_2, "| gvkey ", "| year + gvkey"))
    fm <- felm(as.formula(model), data = reg_data)
    fm
}
```
```{r reg_no_firm_fes, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
fm_year_fe <- lapply(lhs, reg_year_fe, firm_fe = FALSE, cl_2 = TRUE)
stargazer(fm_year_fe, 
          omit=paste0("^(", paste(controls, collapse="|"), ")$"),
          column.labels = gsub("_", "\\\\_", lhs),
          header=FALSE,
          keep.stat = c("n", "rsq", "chi2"))
```

## Plot coefficients

- **Stretch exercise** Produce plots like those below, but using total accruals instead of discretionary accruals and excluding controls (so the coefficients will be simple conditional sample means).

- The following codes exclude controls (so the coefficients will be simple conditional sample means). But where is the total accruals?

```{r alt_reg_functions, include=FALSE}
sho_total_accruals <-
    sho_firm_years %>%
    left_join(df_controls, 
              by = c("gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
    left_join(for_disc_accruals, 
              by = c("gvkey", "fyear")) %>%
    mutate(year = as.factor(year(datadate)))

reg_data_alt <- 
    reg_data %>%
    mutate(year = as.factor(year))

reg_alt <- function(y, firm_fe = FALSE, cl_2 = TRUE) {
    
    model <- paste0(y, " ~ year * pilot - pilot - 1 ",
                      if_else(firm_fe, "| gvkey ", "| 0 "),
                    "| 0 ",
                    if_else(!cl_2, "| gvkey ", "| year + gvkey"))
    fm <- felm(as.formula(model), data = reg_data_alt)
    fm
}
```

```{r reg_alt, include=FALSE}

fm_ta <- lapply(lhs, reg_alt, firm_fe = FALSE, cl_2 = TRUE)

extract_coefficients <- function(model) {
     as_tibble(t(model[["coefficients"]])) %>%
        mutate(dv = colnames(model$coefficients))
}

results_by_year <- 
    bind_rows(lapply(fm_ta, extract_coefficients)) %>% 
    pivot_longer(!matches("dv")) %>%
    filter(grepl("^year.", name)) %>%
    separate(name, into=c("year", "pilot"), sep=":", fill="right") %>%
    mutate(year = gsub("^year", "", year),
           pilot = case_when(pilot == "pilot" ~ TRUE,
                             TRUE ~ FALSE)) %>%
    mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

```{r coef_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
results_by_year %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y=value, color = pilot)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=2000:2012L) +
    geom_rect(xmin=2005, xmax=2007, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf,
                  color = NA, alpha=0.01) +
    facet_wrap(~ dv, ncol = 2)
```
